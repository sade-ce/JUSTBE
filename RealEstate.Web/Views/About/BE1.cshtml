Fundamentally, we feel that like the human body, when your life is in alignment it operates at its optimal level.  Therefore, the place where you start and end your days (along with everything in between) should be the focal point when trying to find alignment in your life."</p>

                                <P>Where most real estate groups simply want to sell you a home, Just BE Real Estate is here to help you feel at home. In an industry saturated with greed, selfishness and apathy, we at Just BE strive to make you feel heard and appreciated, and with our collective knowledge, experience, and technology, that's exactly what we'll do.</P>
                                <p>Just BE has one primary mission above all else, and that is to help you..well….BE! Every step along the way is carefully crafted and meticulously focused on to guarantee that our clients feel prioritized and cared for. No more transaction-focused mentalities, no more hard selling.</p>
                                <p>The experience of buying or selling a home is too meaningful and impactful to simply treat it as a transaction, as so many agents do. We want you to know that we have all been there ourselves, and we understand what pressures and concerns it can bring.</p>

                                <P>We believe buyers and sellers deserve a better experience as they transition into the next chapter of life.  We’ve built a one-of-a-kind platform that incorporates all of our “must-haves” for a successful real estate journey, including an individual deal progress tracker, database of vetted vendors, auto-syncing calendar with key dates, and a document management workspace.</P>
                                <p>Have we mentioned that we have nearly two decades’ worth of experience in the DC real estate industry? In that time, we’ve established strong, meaningful relationships with not only our clients, but with vendors, agents, and other key players in the real estate space. This means that if we don’t know the answer or solution to a problem, we know someone awesome who does.  </p>
                                <p> We’re a bunch of fun (so we’ve been told), hardworking (as we’ve proven), and driven (as you’ll see), folks who love spending time together and with our clients. We’re never in it for the sale. In fact, if a situation doesn’t seem like it’s absolutely the best choice for you, we’ll flat out tell you not to do it. Your successes are our successes, and we’ll do whatever it takes to find the best possible outcome for you. No task is too small, or idea too big. Want to check for noise pollution around an apartment that you’re interested in? Need some extra boxes to pack for your move? Great. We’ve developed customized buyer and seller kits to fit each of our clients’ unique needs. </p>
                                <p>We're so incredibly excited to join you on this journey!"</p>
