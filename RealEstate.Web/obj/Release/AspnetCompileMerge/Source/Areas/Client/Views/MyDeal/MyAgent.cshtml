                                                <p>
                                                    A northeast native, I’ve called the D.C. metro area home for over 20 years. I’ve always had a passion for real estate. Even as a kid, I’d ask my parents if I could join them while they toured model homes. Little did I know that 20 years later I’d be the one bringing clients through model homes and negotiating sales on their behalf! As a Realtor, I’m customer-driven, and always dedicated to exceptional service and results for my clients. I’m licensed in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia, and I specialize in representing both buyers and sellers in the purchase and sale of single-family homes, row homes, townhouses, and condos throughout the D.C. metro area.

                                                    I’m a graduate of Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda and I hold a degree in communications from the University of Delaware. My hobbies include biking, D.C.-area sporting and social events, boating (especially when I have the opportunity to take my clients out on the Potomac), hiking, and helping out where I can in the community. I truly love the D.C. area, and I put my passion and deep knowledge of the area, along with 10 years of real estate experience, to work for each and every client.

                                                    Dana was born into the world of homes. Her grandfather and his twin brother started 'Reinke and Sons’ Construction in South Bend, Indiana which became a residential and commercial building success. Her father developed his skills in masonry, which paid for his degree in Architecture at the University of Cincinnati. Her father's brother became a successful real estate agent in South Bend. Her mother was also bit by the real estate bug and sold real estate in Loveland, Colorado in the 1980’s.

                                                    Without a doubt, Dana's family had a tremendous influence on her desire to become a Realtor back in 1996. Her career in real estate began in Boulder, Colorado, where she was later recruited by a top real estate brokerage to work predominantly as a Buyer’s Agent and Relocation Specialist.

She also enjoys working with investors and developers to find viable properties to renovate in the DC metro area. Dana's desire is to make the home buying and selling experience as enjoyable and stress free as possible for her clients.
