                                                    Lender Call / Questionnaire - The best first step that you can take when considering a home purchase is to speak with a lender.  Often times, Buyers will over estimate or under estimate what they can actually afford.  Getting off on sound financial footing is a crucial step when setting up your home search criteria.  Why waste time focusing on homes that are out of reach or checking out homes that are below par for what you could potentially afford.  A great lender can advise you on steps that you can take before officially beginning your home search or during the process that can have a positive impact on your bottom line.  Sage advice could potentially save you thousands of dollars over the term of your mortgage loan.

Typically a lender will have you fill out a lender questionnaire followed by a a brief phone call to get a snapshot of your financial situation.  Once they run you through their system your lender will be able to generate a pre-approval letter.  While this letter is not a guarantee of lender approval, it’s enough to for you to be able to make an offer for a property within the price range of your Pre-Approval letter.

This agreement is legally required before an agent is allowed to take you through a property.  In essence it protects both the Buyer and the Agent.  If a Buyer were to inadvertently reach out to the listing agent on a property and make arrangements to see it without having a Buyer agency agreement in place with their Agent, then technically the Listing Agent could make the argument that they were procuring cause and cut your Agent out of the loop.  This agreement may be terminated by either party at any time.

We may ask more questions than most, but its because we take a different approach to real estate.  We aren’t selling you a home, we view it as selling you a life that you will love and that falls in line with your goals.  At this stage, we generally like when possible to meet in person and build out your search together.

                                                    Ratified Offer (Contract) - Ahh…the moment you’ve been waiting for and the pivotal point where working with us and this dashboard really comes into play.  A ratified contract by definition means that both parties have come to an agreement.  The ratified date on the contract is the date that all (if any) contingencies in a contract are tied to.  Most agents and brokers focus their time on the front end of the home buying process (the search).  While we agree that this is an important component, we feel that once a deal is ratified there is more value that we can provide to out clients to better guide them through the process.  That is why we have created this dashboard for you to use.  The goal is simple, we understand that the stress levels can increase once an offer is ratified.  For this reason we wanted to make sure that there was a place that Buyers and Sellers could turn to that would provide all the info, dates, and documents that were relevant to their deal.  Real Estate transactions are date and time sensitive.  By using our client dashboard, our hope is that you will never feel left in the dark.  All contingency dates are tied to the date of ratification.

                                                    Home Inspection Contingency - More often than not, especially in a non-competitive offer situation, we will include a Home Inspection Contingency in our offer.  The purpose of this contingency is to allow Buyers an opportunity to conduct a 3rd party inspection of the property.  Many of the rowhomes in DC were built between 1890-1920.  With this contingency a Buyer can have greater peace of mind moving forward in the transaction, or be made aware of an issue that might cause them to reconsider.  In most cases the items that come up in an inspection can be negotiated and between the Buyer and Seller.  The Buyer may choose the number of days they have from the date of ratification to perform their inspection.  Assuming the Seller has agreed, the Buyer will have that many days from date of ratification to complete the inspection and equally as important get the Home Inspection Notice document to the Seller either asking for repairs, a credit, or possible declaring the contract void.  At this point, the Seller can either agree or counter.  Each counter allows the other party three (3) calendar days to respond.

                                                    Appraisal Contingency - An Appraisal Contingency, when used, is there to protect the Buyer should the value of the property be less than the agreed upon sales price between the Buyer and Seller in the ratified contract.  In the event an appraisal comes in lower than the contract amount, the Buyer has the right to ask the Seller to reduce the Sales Price to the appraised value.  The Seller may then choose to accept, reject, counter, or challenge the appraisal (often it is the Buyer who winds up challenging the appraisal.  In reality, more often than not, the Appraisal comes back at a satisfactory value.  In the event that the Appraisal comes back at above list price, the Buyer (in theory) is getting the property with some equity already in the property.

More often then not, especially if you are using a trusted lender and Realtor your ducks are already in a row prior to submitting an offer.  However in the unlikely event that a Buyer has a major set back, whether due to a health condition, loss of job, or anything else that might happen between the time a contract is ratified and settlement occurs to negatively affect a Buyer's ability to obtain financing, they would be protected by this Contingency.

                                                    This clause is used when a buyer is under contract and needs to move into the home prior to settlement.  This generally can only happen if the home is already vacant or the Seller intends to leave prior to the Buyer moving in.  A Buyer might choose to do this in the even that they need to settle on the sale of their current home before settling on the new home.  This clause acts as a bridge in this gap period of not having a home.  The Buyer will then negotiate an agreed upon per diem rate for living in their new home prior to becoming the owner.  These can be tricky.

Settlement generally takes place at a settlement office and is the process by which a property transfers from one owner to another.  A good settlement officer will walk you through the loan docs (if any) and deed.  The most important document for both Buyers and Sellers to review is the ALTA Statement (formerly the HUD-1).  This is the net sheet that breaks down the costs of the sale / purchase and shows what the Seller stands to collect (or owes) and the Buyer needs to bring to the table for the purchase.
