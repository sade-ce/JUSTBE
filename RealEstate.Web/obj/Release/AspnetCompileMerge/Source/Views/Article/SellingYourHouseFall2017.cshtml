                            2.  There Is Less Competition Now
                        </h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Housing inventory is still under the 6-month supply that is needed for a normal housing market.
                            This means that, in the majority of the country, there are not enough homes for sale to satisfy the
                            number of buyers in the market. This is good news for homeowners who have gained equity as their
                            home values have increased. However, additional inventory could be coming to the market soon.

                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Historically, the average number of years a homeowner stayed in their home was six, but has
                            jumped to an average of almost nine years since 2008. There is a pent-up desire for many
                            homeowners to move, as they were unable to sell over the last few years because of a negative
                            equity situation. As home values continue to appreciate, more and more homeowners will be given
                            the freedom to move.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            The choices buyers have will continue to increase. Don’t wait until this other inventory comes to
                            market before you decide to sell.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            3.  The Process Will Be Quicker
                        </h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Today’s competitive environment has forced buyers to do all they can to stand out from the crowd,
                            including getting pre-approved for their mortgage financing. This makes the entire selling process
                            much faster and much simpler as buyers know exactly what they can afford before home shopping.
                            According to Ellie Mae’s latest Origination Insights Report, the time to close a loan has dropped to 43
                            days, after seeing a 12-month high of 48 days in January.

                        <h3>4. There Will Never Be a Better Time to Move Up</h3>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            If your next move will be into a premium or luxury home, now is the time to move-up! The inventory
                            of homes for sale at these higher price ranges has forced these markets into a buyer’s market. This
                            means that if you are planning on selling a starter or trade-up home, your home will sell quickly
                            AND you’ll be able to find a premium home to call your own! 
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Prices are projected to appreciate by 5.2% over the next year according to CoreLogic. If you are
                            moving to a higher-priced home, it will wind up costing you more in raw dollars (both in down
                            payment and mortgage payment) if you wait.
                        </p>

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Look at the reason you decided to sell in the first place and determine whether it is worth waiting.
                            Is money more important than being with family? Is money more important than your health? Is
                            money more important than having the freedom to go on with your life the way you think you
                            should?

                            situation by putting your home on the market. Perhaps the time has come for you and your family
                            to move on and start living the life you desire.
