                                The Just BE. website and client portal were developed to provide you, the client, with key information you will need during your search for and/or sale of real estate property. The site also provides you an online platform where your real estate deal can be tracked. It does not replace any legal or financial advice you may receive during a standard real estate deal. During your journey and while working with us, we will send you email notifications with updates to your real estate deal, and we ask that you notify us if your main email address changes.
